# Comments

In programming, a comment is a line of code that is not executed by the computer, but is used to provide additional information or explanation about the surrounding code. Comments are typically ignored by the compiler or interpreter and do not affect the execution of the program. They are often used to:

1. Explain what a particular piece of code does or why it was written in a certain way.
2. Provide notes or instructions for other developers who may need to understand or modify the code in the future.
3. Temporarily disable a line of code without deleting it.
4. Add debugging statements to help diagnose issues with the code.
5. Include version control information, such as revision numbers or author names.
6. Document classes, functions, variables, and other elements of the code.
7. Provide copyright or licensing information.
8. Include boilerplate text, such as standard error handling or initialization code.
9. Add annotations or metadata to the code, such as todo lists, bug references, or performance optimization hints.

Comments can be identified by their syntax, which varies depending on the programming language. In most languages, comments start with a specific symbol or keyword, such as `//`, `#`, or `/*` `*/`, and continue until the end of the current line or block of code. Some languages also support multiline comments, which allow comments to span multiple lines.

## Types of Comments in JavaScript

1. Single Line Comment
2. Multi-Line Comment

### Single Line Comments

- Single-line comments are created by using two forward slashes `//`.
- Anything after the two forward slashes will ignored by the JavaScript interpreter.
- This is useful when you want to add a comment to a single line of code.

```javascript
// This is a single-line comment

console.log('I am Talim'); // This is a single-line comment
```

### Multi-Line Comments

- Multi-line comments are created using `/*` and `*/`.
- Anything between these two symbols will be ignored by the JavaScript interpreter.
- This is useful when you want to add a comment to multiple lines of code.

```javascript
/*
 * This is a multi-line comment
 */
```
